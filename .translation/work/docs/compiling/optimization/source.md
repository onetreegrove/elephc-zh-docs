elephc optimizes in two places: over the AST before lowering, and over EIR after
lowering. The AST optimizer is always on. The EIR-level controls below let you
turn passes off for benchmarking and diagnostics, and choose between code-shape
trade-offs.

## Two optimization layers

- **AST optimizer** — PHP-preserving rewrites expressed over syntax: constant
  folding, constant propagation, control-flow pruning and normalization, and
  dead-code elimination. Always on; not behind a flag. See
  [The Optimizer](../internals/the-optimizer.md).
- **EIR optimization passes** — transformations that need value identity, basic
  blocks, or dominance, which the AST cannot express well. Run by a fixed-point
  pass driver after lowering. Controlled by `--ir-opt`. See
  [The EIR Design](../internals/the-ir.md#optimization-passes).

## EIR optimization passes

After the AST is lowered to EIR and validated, a fixed-point pass driver runs the
registered transformation passes over each function until none reports a change.
The whole pipeline runs to a **module-level fixed point**: each round runs the
cross-function [small-function inliner](#small-function-inlining) and then drives the
per-function passes to convergence on every function, repeating until neither the
inliner nor any function pass changes anything. Interleaving lets the two layers feed
each other — inlined bodies expose new constants and dead code, and the simplified
functions expose new (smaller) inline candidates. The passes are **on by default**.

```bash
# Default: EIR optimization passes enabled
elephc hot.php

# Disable them (for A/B comparison or diagnostics)
elephc --no-ir-opt hot.php
elephc --ir-opt=off hot.php

# Explicit enable
elephc --ir-opt=on hot.php
```

The environment variable `ELEPHC_IR_OPT=off` disables the passes for a whole run
without editing each command.

In debug and test builds the driver re-validates each function after **every**
pass and aborts if a pass produced malformed IR, so optimization bugs surface
immediately during development. In release builds those checks are compiled out.

### Identity arithmetic folding

The first registered pass folds algebraic identities on integer and float
arithmetic and bitwise operations:

| Pattern | Result |
|---|---|
| `x + 0`, `0 + x`, `x - 0` | `x` |
| `x * 1`, `1 * x`, `x / 1` | `x` |
| `x \| 0`, `x ^ 0`, `x << 0`, `x >> 0` | `x` |
| `x & x`, `x \| x` | `x` |
| `x * 1.0`, `x / 1.0` | `x` |
| `x ^ x`, `x - x`, `x * 0`, `x & 0`, `x % 1` | `0` |

Only PHP-equivalent rewrites are applied: integer `x / 0` and `x % 0` are left to
trap at runtime, and float additive-zero (`x + 0.0`) and `x * 0.0` are excluded
because signed zero and `NaN` make them observable.

You can see the effect directly with [`--emit-ir`](output-and-diagnostics.md#--emit-ir):

```bash
# With passes on, `$argc * 1` folds away; with --no-ir-opt it stays an `imul`.
elephc --emit-ir app.php
elephc --emit-ir --no-ir-opt app.php
```

This is a peephole-level optimization. It speeds up code that contains redundant
identity operations in hot paths and is a no-op on code that does not — unlike
register allocation, which helps broadly.

### Peephole patterns

The second registered pass applies local rewrites that clean up the shape of
lowered EIR. Each is refcount-balanced and produces output identical to PHP:

| Pattern | Rewrite |
|---|---|
| Box/unbox cancellation | `unbox(box(x))` → `x` for scalar (`NonHeap`) payloads |
| Redundant `move`/`borrow` | a forwarding op whose result has the same ownership and type as its operand folds to the operand |
| Load/store forwarding | a `load` of a scalar local right after a `store` to it reads the stored value directly |
| Dead store | storing a scalar local the value it already holds is removed |
| Acquire/release cancellation | an `acquire` whose result is consumed only by its `release` drops both |
| String-literal concat folding | `concat("a", "b")` → the single literal `"ab"` |

Load/store forwarding and dead-store removal apply only to non-aliased scalar
locals, so reference semantics and copy-on-write are never affected. The
remaining patterns only fold when ownership and type are preserved, so cleanup
and refcounting stay balanced.

You can see the effect with [`--emit-ir`](output-and-diagnostics.md#--emit-ir):
`$x = $argc; echo $x;` forwards the load so the `echo` reads the stored value and
the `load_local` becomes a `nop`.

### Constant folding

The third registered pass folds operations whose operands are all compile-time
constants into a single constant, in place. It covers integer arithmetic
(`iadd`, `isub`, `imul`), bitwise ops, in-range shifts, unary `ineg`/`ibit_not`,
float `fadd`/`fsub`/`fmul`/`fneg`, signed integer comparisons (`icmp`), and the
`is_null`/`is_truthy` predicates. A constant value in EIR is the same constant at
every use, so a single forward scan discovers constant operands and collapses
chains like `(2 + 3) * 4` in one sweep.

Each fold reproduces exactly what the op's lowering computes at runtime, so the
compiled result never changes: integers wrap at 64 bits (matching the native
`add`/`sub`/`mul`), shifts fold only for counts in `0..=63`, and the trapping
integer division/modulo and `NaN`-sensitive float division are left untouched.

Together with the peephole's scalar load/store forwarding — which moves a
constant assigned to a local onto its later uses — this realizes per-block
constant propagation over EIR value ids *and* local slots: the peephole carries
the constant through the slot, and this pass folds the constant-operand
operation built on it. Constants surfaced by identity arithmetic feed it too:
`($argc * 0 + 5) * ($argc * 0 + 5)` reduces to `$argc * 0` → `const_i64 0`
(identity), then `0 + 5` → `5`, then `5 * 5` → `const_i64 25` (this pass), with
the three `imul`s eliminated.

### Common subexpression elimination

The fourth registered pass removes a pure computation when an identical one is
already available on every path to it, redirecting its uses to the earlier
value. It does both per-block and cross-block elimination in one dominator-tree
value-numbering traversal: a scoped table maps each pure instruction's
`(op, result type, immediate, operands)` to the value that first computed it, and
because blocks are visited in dominator-tree order the table holds exactly the
definitions that dominate the current block. A match is therefore an earlier,
dominating value, so the redirection is safe; the redundant instruction becomes a
`nop`.

Only pure (side-effect-free) instructions that have at least one operand and a
`NonHeap` or `Persistent` result are eligible — their value depends on their
operands alone and they carry no owned-heap cleanup, so the rewrite is
refcount-neutral. SSA operands are equal-by-value, so identical pure ops on
identical operands compute identical results. Bare constant and address
materializations (`const_*`, `data_addr`) are *not* deduplicated: they are
cheaper to rematerialize than to keep live, so CSE only targets computations.
Functions that use exception handling are skipped, because a dominator over the
terminator graph can be bypassed at runtime by a throw to a handler.

Combined with the peephole's load forwarding, `($n + 1) * ($n + 1)` loads `$n`
once and computes `$n + 1` once. The redundant instructions it neutralizes leave
dead operands that dead-instruction elimination then removes.

### Loop-invariant code motion

The fifth registered pass moves a pure computation whose operands do not change
across a loop out of the loop body and into the loop's preheader, so it runs once
instead of every iteration. It builds the loop forest on the dominator tree, then
for each loop grows an invariant set to a fixed point: an instruction is invariant
when each operand is either defined outside the loop (its definition dominates the
preheader) or is itself being hoisted.

Only pure instructions with at least one operand and a `NonHeap`/`Persistent`
result are hoisted — purity means the result depends only on the operands and the
op neither reads mutable state nor faults, so evaluating it once in the preheader
(unconditionally, even if its original block ran only on some iterations) is safe.
Loops are processed innermost-first, so a value invariant in several nested loops
moves all the way to the outermost preheader. Loops without a detected preheader,
and functions using exception handling, are skipped.

Because PHP loop variables live in local slots and are reloaded through impure
`load_local` each iteration, an invariant *source* expression is not yet a
pure-operand computation this pass can hoist; its reach grows as more values flow
as SSA across loops.

### Dead instruction elimination

The sixth registered pass computes CFG liveness and neutralizes unused
result-producing instructions whose effect metadata says they are pure. This
cleans up dead values exposed by earlier EIR rewrites. For example, identity
folding can turn `$argc + 0` into `$argc`; dead-instruction elimination then
drops the now-unused `const_i64 0` from optimized EIR.

The pass is deliberately conservative. It keeps read-only, allocation,
mutation, refcounting, output, warning, fatal, throw, and deopt-capable
instructions even when their results are unused. The goal is to remove dead pure
arithmetic and literal scaffolding without changing PHP-visible behavior or
ownership cleanup.

You can compare the shape directly:

```bash
elephc --emit-ir app.php
elephc --emit-ir --no-ir-opt app.php
```

### Dead store elimination

The seventh registered pass removes `store_local` writes whose value is never read
before the slot is overwritten or the function exits. It computes backward,
CFG-aware liveness over local slots (a `load_local` makes a slot live, a
`store_local` kills it) so a dead store is dropped even when the overwrite is in a
later block. Unlike the peephole's per-block, value-equality store drop, this pass
is liveness-based and crosses block boundaries, so it removes a store of a
*different* value whose result is never observed.

It is restricted to non-refcounted scalar locals that are accessed only through
plain `load_local`/`store_local` and never escape by reference. Refcounted slots
are wrapped by separate `acquire`/`release` ownership ops, and by-reference call
arguments or closure captures alias the slot through its `load_local`, so both are
left untouched to keep reference counting and aliasing semantics intact.

### Branch simplification

The eighth registered pass prunes the control-flow graph three ways:

- **Constant-condition folding** — a `cond_br` whose condition is a constant
  (`const_bool`, non-zero `const_i64`, or `const_null`) becomes an unconditional
  `br` to the taken edge; a `switch` on a constant scrutinee folds to its matching
  case. A `while (true)` loop, for instance, lowers to a constant `cond_br` that
  this fold collapses.
- **Empty-block jump threading** — predecessors of an empty, parameterless
  forwarding block (one that only branches onward) are redirected to the end of
  the forwarding chain.
- **Unreachable-block removal** — blocks no longer reachable from the entry are
  neutralized (terminator set to `unreachable`, instructions to `nop`).

Functions that use exception handling are skipped, because their handler blocks
are reachable through implicit edges that the terminator graph does not show.

### Small-function inlining

As part of the module-level fixed point, a cross-function pass inlines calls to small
user functions directly into their callers; the per-function passes then optimize the
expanded bodies, and because the pipeline iterates, a callee that only becomes small
enough after that optimization is inlined on a later round. A callee is inlined only
when **all** of the following hold:

- its body is at most **24** non-`nop` instructions;
- it is **non-recursive**, directly *or* mutually — a call-graph cycle analysis
  excludes any function that can reach itself, and a per-caller fuel cap backstops
  termination;
- it contains no exception-handling ops and is not a generator or fiber wrapper;
- it exposes a **destructor-free boundary and body**: no by-reference or variadic
  parameters, and every parameter, the return value and every local slot has a
  destructor-free type — scalars (`int`/`float`/`bool`/`string`) and arrays/unions
  whose elements are themselves destructor-free. Objects, packed classes, closures,
  resources, generic `iterable`/`mixed`, buffers, and ref-cell/static/global/capture
  locals are excluded.

The last rule is a correctness requirement, not just a heuristic. The splice replaces
the callee's `return` with a jump, bypassing the callee's implicit epilogue cleanup, so
the inliner reproduces that cleanup's per-slot decisions: parameter slots and
directly-returned slots (which the callee excludes — the argument is borrowed and the
return value's ownership moves to the caller) are transplanted so the host epilogue
ignores them, while ordinary refcounted internal locals are still freed by the host
epilogue. The only residual difference is *when* those internal locals are freed
(deferred to the host epilogue), which is unobservable precisely because the types are
destructor-free — no `__destruct` runs and arrays carry no observable identity. Types
that can run a destructor (objects, or arrays/mixed that may hold them) and by-reference
parameters (which alias caller storage) are therefore excluded, because a value-copy
splice cannot reproduce their cleanup timing or aliasing. As with all EIR passes,
inlining is gated by `--ir-opt` and changes only performance, never observable behavior.

Later releases extend this driver with further EIR passes.

## Register allocation

The EIR backend uses a linear-scan register allocator (Poletto–Sarkar) by
default, keeping hot scalar values in registers across calls instead of spilling
them to the stack on every use.

```bash
# Default: linear-scan registers
elephc hot.php

# Fall back to stack-only placement (spill everything)
elephc --regalloc=stack hot.php
```

`ELEPHC_REGALLOC=stack` applies the fallback to a whole run. The stack fallback
exists mainly for comparison and debugging; linear scan is substantially faster
on compute-heavy code.

## Null representation

`--null-repr` selects how null-capable scalar slots are stored:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `tagged` (default) | Inline two-word `{payload, tag}` scalars. |
| `sentinel` | In-band `PHP_INT_MAX - 1` sentinel in one-word slots (legacy opt-out). |

```bash
elephc --null-repr=sentinel legacy.php
```

`ELEPHC_NULL_REPR` overrides the default for a whole run. Most programs should
use the default; `sentinel` exists as a legacy opt-out. See
[Memory Model](../internals/memory-model.md).

## The frozen legacy backend

`--ast-backend` selects the legacy direct AST→assembly backend. It is
**deprecated**, frozen (no new language or runtime features), emits a warning,
and is scheduled for removal in v0.26.0. Use it only to compare behavior with the
old backend during the transition. The EIR backend is the default and the only
active implementation target.
