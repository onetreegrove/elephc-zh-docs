## Hello, World

Create a file called `hello.php`:

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!\n";
```

Compile it:

```bash
elephc hello.php
```

This produces a native binary called `hello` in the same directory. Run it:

```bash
./hello
```

```
Hello, World!
```

That's it — a standalone native binary, no PHP interpreter needed.

## A slightly bigger example

Create `greet.php`:

```php
<?php
if ($argc < 2) {
    echo "Usage: ./greet <name>\n";
    exit(1);
}

$name = $argv[1];
echo "Hello, " . strtoupper($name) . "!\n";
```

Compile and run:

```bash
elephc greet.php
./greet elephc
```

```
Hello, ELEPHC!
```

The program reads command-line arguments through `$argc` and `$argv`, just like PHP.

## FizzBuzz

A classic example to see variables, loops, and conditionals in action:

```php
<?php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 100; $i++) {
    if ($i % 15 == 0) {
        echo "FizzBuzz\n";
    } elseif ($i % 3 == 0) {
        echo "Fizz\n";
    } elseif ($i % 5 == 0) {
        echo "Buzz\n";
    } else {
        echo $i . "\n";
    }
}
```

```bash
elephc fizzbuzz.php
./fizzbuzz
```

## What happens under the hood

When you run `elephc hello.php`, the compiler:

1. **Lexes** the source into tokens
2. **Parses** tokens into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
3. **Lowers** file-local magic constants and applies `ifdef` branches from `--define`
4. **Builds** the compile-time autoload registry from Composer metadata and supported `spl_autoload_register()` rules
5. **Resolves** `include` / `require` files, pre-scans statically resolvable include declarations, folds compile-time include paths, and lowers `*_once` runtime guards
6. **Resolves** namespaces, imports, and fully-qualified names
7. **Runs** static autoload insertion for referenced class-like symbols
8. **Folds** constant expressions that are already statically known
9. **Type-checks** the program and collects non-fatal warnings
10. **Optimizes** checked AST control flow through propagation, pruning, normalization, and dead-code elimination
11. **Lowers** the checked AST into validated EIR
12. **Generates** target assembly from EIR
13. **Prepares** or reuses the cached runtime object
14. **Assembles and links** the `.s` / `.o` files into a native executable

The intermediate `.s` and `.o` files are cleaned up automatically. You're left with a single executable.

## Useful inspection flags

If you want to inspect the compile more closely, these flags are a good starting point:

```bash
# Print per-phase compiler timings to stderr
elephc --timings hello.php

# Emit assembly only, plus a sidecar source-map file
elephc --emit-asm --source-map hello.php
```

`--timings` reports phases such as lexing, parsing, early optimization, type checking, constant propagation, post-check pruning, control-flow normalization, dead-code elimination, runtime-cache preparation, code generation, assembling, and linking.

`--source-map` writes a `hello.map` JSON file next to `hello.s`. The map records which emitted assembly lines came from which PHP source lines and columns.

If you want to compare elephc against the PHP interpreter and equivalent C fixtures, see the [benchmark suite](https://github.com/illegalstudio/elephc/blob/main/benchmarks/README.md).
