**Source:** default backend `src/ir_lower/`, `src/ir/`, and `src/codegen_ir/`; shared target/runtime infrastructure under `src/codegen/abi/`, `src/codegen/runtime/`, `src/codegen/platform/`, `src/codegen/emit.rs`, and `src/codegen/data_section.rs`; frozen legacy AST backend under `src/codegen/expr.rs`, `src/codegen/expr/`, `src/codegen/stmt.rs`, `src/codegen/stmt/`, `src/codegen/functions/`, and `src/codegen/builtins/`; intrinsic method registry: `src/intrinsics.rs`

The code generator (codegen) is the heart of the compiler. The default path lowers the checked and optimized AST into EIR first, then emits native assembly text for the selected target from that EIR. The temporary `--ast-backend` fallback still walks the checked AST directly and emits assembly while the legacy emitter remains in-tree.

elephc currently supports more than one backend. AArch64 is still the clearest reference path in the codebase and in this document, while Linux `x86_64` is also a supported backend that goes through the same high-level lowering pipeline.

Most snippets below use AArch64 because the instruction forms are compact and the surrounding docs already explain them in detail. When a section talks about target-specific ABI or runtime behavior, it calls out Linux `x86_64` explicitly.

For an introduction to AArch64, see [Introduction to ARM64 Assembly](arm64-assembly.md).

## Overview

In the default path, `src/ir_lower/` walks the checked optimized AST, produces validated EIR, and `src/codegen_ir/` emits assembly for each EIR function, instruction, and terminator. The CLI's main output is the **user program assembly**; the shared runtime helpers are usually assembled separately and reused from the runtime object cache. The user-facing `.s` file still has this structure:

```asm
.global _main
.align 2

; --- user-defined functions ---
_fn_factorial:
    ...
    ret

; --- class methods ---
_method_Point_move:
    ...
    ret

; --- main program ---
_main:
    ; prologue (stack frame setup)
    ; global argc/argv initialization
    ; program statements
    ; epilogue (exit syscall)

; --- deferred closures emitted after _main ---
_closure_1:
    ...
    ret

; --- data section ---
.data
_str_0: .ascii "hello"
_float_0: .quad 0x400921FB54442D18

; --- source markers used by --source-map ---
; @src line=12 col=5
```

Trait composition does not add a separate runtime dispatch layer. Traits are flattened into each concrete class during type checking, then inheritance metadata is layered on top. Codegen still emits `_method_Class_method` / `_static_Class_method` labels, but instance calls now use vtable slots keyed by `class_id` so child overrides work through inherited methods.

The exact directives and symbol decoration vary by target. The example above is intentionally AArch64-flavored, but the same structural phases apply on Linux `x86_64`.

When you call the legacy library-style `codegen::generate(...)` entry point, elephc still exposes both pieces explicitly as `(user_asm, runtime_asm)`. The normal CLI path lowers to EIR, calls `codegen_ir::generate_user_asm_from_ir_with_options(...)`, and links against the runtime-object cache so repeated compiles do not have to reassemble the same shared runtime text every time.

## The Emitter

**File:** `src/codegen/emit.rs`

The `Emitter` is a simple string buffer with helper methods:

| Method | Output |
|---|---|
| `instruction("mov x0, #42")` | `    mov x0, #42\n` (indented) |
| `label("_main")` | `_main:\n` |
| `comment("load variable")` | `    ; load variable\n` |
| `raw(".global _main")` | `.global _main\n` (no indent) |
| `blank()` | `\n` |

All assembly is built as text, then written to the `.s` file.

Statement emission also injects source markers of the form `@src line=<N> col=<M>`. They are ignored by the assembler as comments, but the CLI can later scan them to build a simple source-map sidecar file when `--source-map` is enabled.

## Runtime split, cache, and source maps

The compiler's codegen/runtime handoff now has three distinct artifacts:

1. **User assembly** — emitted by the selected backend into the per-build `.s` file
2. **Runtime object** — assembled from the shared runtime once and cached under `~/.cache/elephc/` (or `XDG_CACHE_HOME`) using the compiler version, target, heap size, and generated runtime assembly hash in the filename
3. **Optional source map** — a JSON sidecar generated from `@src` markers embedded in the user assembly comments

This means normal CLI builds no longer concatenate the runtime text into every output assembly file before assembling. Instead, they:

- prepare or reuse the cached runtime object
- assemble only the user `.s` file into `file.o`
- link `file.o` against the cached runtime object

The source-map file is intentionally simple. Today it stores a list of `(asm_line, php_line, php_col)` entries so tools and humans can correlate generated assembly back to the original PHP statements without needing full DWARF debug info.

The AST optimizer intentionally still runs before backend selection. By the time the default EIR backend runs, constant expressions and some dead control-flow have already been removed, and EIR adds the function-wide value and control-flow shape that the linear-scan register allocator (`src/ir_passes/`, see [The IR](the-ir.md)) and future IR optimizations rely on. The legacy AST backend sees the same optimized AST when `--ast-backend` is selected.

## Emit modes: executable vs cdylib

Codegen runs in one of two emit modes selected by the `--emit` flag. `executable` (the default) produces the standalone-binary shape described throughout this page: a `main` entry point, top-level statements, and a process-exit epilogue. `cdylib` produces a shared library instead: no `main` body is emitted, and after the user functions a set of C-ABI trampolines is appended for every `#[Export]`-marked function plus the four `elephc_*` lifecycle entry points (see [Shared Libraries](../beyond-php/cdylib.md)).

Cdylib emission also switches the emitter into position-independent mode (`pic_data_refs`): global data references emitted through the `abi::symbols` helpers resolve through the GOT (`@GOTPCREL` on x86_64, `:got:`/`:got_lo12:` on AArch64) instead of direct PC-relative addressing, and the runtime object is generated and cached separately in a PIC variant. On ELF targets a final pass (`src/codegen/visibility.rs`) appends `.hidden` directives for every internal global so the `.so` exports only its public ABI and internal runtime state cannot be preempted across loaded modules.

## The Context

**File:** `src/codegen/context.rs`

The `Context` tracks state during code generation:

```rust
pub struct Context {
    pub variables: HashMap<String, VarInfo>,  // variable → type + stack offset
    pub stack_offset: usize,                  // next available stack slot
    pub loop_stack: Vec<LoopLabels>,          // for break/continue
    pub return_label: Option<String>,         // for early returns
    pub functions: HashMap<String, FunctionSig>,
    pub function_variant_groups: HashSet<String>, // include-loaded function dispatchers
    pub deferred_closures: Vec<DeferredClosure>, // closures emitted after current function
    pub deferred_fiber_wrappers: Vec<DeferredFiberWrapper>,
    pub deferred_callback_wrappers: Vec<DeferredCallbackWrapper>,
    pub constants: HashMap<String, (ExprKind, PhpType)>, // compile-time constants
    pub global_vars: HashSet<String>,         // globals active in current scope
    pub static_vars: HashSet<String>,         // statics active in current scope
    pub ref_params: HashSet<String>,          // pass-by-reference params
    pub local_ref_cell_flags: HashMap<String, LocalRefCellFlag>, // compiler-created ref cells
    pub in_main: bool,                        // whether we're compiling top-level code
    pub all_global_var_names: HashSet<String>,
    pub all_static_vars: HashMap<(String, String), PhpType>,
    pub closure_sigs: HashMap<String, FunctionSig>,
    pub callable_param_sigs: HashMap<(String, String), FunctionSig>,
    pub closure_captures: HashMap<String, Vec<(String, PhpType, bool)>>,
    pub runtime_callable_builtin_wrappers: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub runtime_callable_extern_wrappers: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub runtime_callable_static_method_wrappers: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub first_class_callable_targets: HashMap<String, CallableTarget>,
    pub variable_fcc_label: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub classes: HashMap<String, ClassInfo>,
    pub interfaces: HashMap<String, InterfaceInfo>,
    pub traits: HashSet<String>,
    pub enums: HashMap<String, EnumInfo>,
    pub packed_classes: HashMap<String, PackedClassInfo>,
    pub current_class: Option<String>,
    pub extern_functions: HashMap<String, ExternFunctionSig>,
    pub extern_classes: HashMap<String, ExternClassInfo>,
    pub extern_globals: HashMap<String, PhpType>,
    pub return_type: PhpType,
    pub activation_prev_offset: Option<usize>,
    pub activation_cleanup_offset: Option<usize>,
    pub activation_frame_base_offset: Option<usize>,
    pub pending_action_offset: Option<usize>,
    pub pending_target_offset: Option<usize>,
    pub nested_concat_offset_offset: Option<usize>,
    pub pending_return_value_offset: Option<usize>,
    pub try_slot_offsets: Vec<usize>,
    pub next_try_slot_idx: usize,
    pub finally_stack: Vec<FinallyContext>,
}
```

Each variable has a `VarInfo`:

```rust
pub struct VarInfo {
    pub ty: PhpType,                  // current runtime storage type
    pub static_ty: PhpType,           // declared/static type retained for checks and calls
    pub stack_offset: usize,          // offset from frame pointer (x29)
    pub ownership: HeapOwnership,     // NonHeap / Owned / Borrowed / MaybeOwned
    pub epilogue_cleanup_safe: bool,  // false for locals populated through still-ambiguous control-flow/alias paths
}
```

`HeapOwnership` is a codegen-only ownership lattice used for heap-backed values flowing through stack slots:

- `NonHeap` — integers, floats, bools, null, resources, raw pointers
- `Owned` — this slot definitely owns the current heap-backed value
- `Borrowed` — this slot currently aliases heap storage owned elsewhere
- `MaybeOwned` — control flow merged heap-backed paths with different ownership states

The lattice is now threaded through the main local-variable paths. Function epilogues re-enable cleanup only for slots classified as `Owned` and still marked `epilogue_cleanup_safe`; locals coming from still-ambiguous control-flow or aliasing paths are intentionally skipped. Special aliases such as `$this`, by-reference params, globals, and statics are explicitly kept out of epilogue cleanup because the current frame does not own their storage. Builtins that duplicate containers now also dispatch to dedicated `_refcounted` runtime helpers when their element/value types are heap-backed, so nested array/hash/object/string payloads are retained before the new container becomes an owner.

The exception-related fields let codegen thread `try` / `catch` / `finally` through non-local control flow. Function and `_main` frames publish activation records into the runtime cleanup stack, pre-allocate handler slots for `setjmp` buffers, and use `finally_stack` plus the `pending_*` slots to defer `return`, `break`, and `continue` until the innermost `finally` body has run.

### Label generation

`ctx.next_label("while")` produces `_while_1`, `_while_2`, etc. A global atomic counter ensures labels never collide across functions or compilation units.

## The Data Section

**File:** `src/codegen/data_section.rs`

String literals and float constants are stored in the `.data` section:

```rust
pub struct DataSection {
    entries: Vec<(String, Vec<u8>)>,          // string label → bytes
    float_entries: Vec<(String, u64)>,        // float label → bit pattern
    counter: usize,                           // next unique label suffix
    dedup: HashMap<Vec<u8>, String>,          // avoid duplicate strings
    float_dedup: HashMap<u64, String>,        // avoid duplicate floats
}
```

When the codegen encounters `"hello"`, it calls `data.add_string(b"hello")` which returns a label (`_str_0`) and length (`5`). Identical strings are deduplicated — two `"hello"` literals share the same label.

Floats are stored as their raw 64-bit IEEE 754 bit patterns (`.quad` directive).

## Legacy AST expression codegen

**Files:** `src/codegen/expr.rs`, `src/codegen/expr/`

The frozen `--ast-backend` path still uses `emit_expr()` to take an expression node and emit code that leaves the result in the standard registers. The default backend reaches the same ABI/runtime helpers through EIR lowering in `src/ir_lower/` and instruction lowering in `src/codegen_ir/`. The top-level legacy `expr.rs` file mainly dispatches into focused helpers under `expr/` such as `scalars.rs`, `variables.rs`, `binops/`, `arrays.rs`, `compare/`, `calls/`, and `objects/`.

| Type | Result location |
|---|---|
| `Int` / `Bool` / `Void` / `Resource` | `x0` |
| `Float` | `d0` |
| `Str` | `x1` (pointer), `x2` (length) |
| `Array` / `AssocArray` / `Iterable` | `x0` (heap pointer) |
| `Mixed` | `x0` (pointer to boxed mixed cell) |
| `Object` | `x0` (heap pointer) |
| `Callable` / `Pointer` | `x0` |
| `Buffer` / `Packed` | `x0` (heap pointer) |
| `Union` | `x0` (same as Mixed — boxed runtime-tagged payload) |

### Expression AST dispatch coverage

The legacy expression dispatcher is intentionally thin. It routes each `ExprKind`
variant into one of the focused lowering paths below, while the EIR path mirrors the same PHP-visible coverage through `src/ir_lower/expr/`:

| Variants | Lowering path |
|---|---|
| `StringLiteral`, `IntLiteral`, `FloatLiteral`, `BoolLiteral`, `Null`, `Negate`, `Not`, `BitNot`, `Cast`, `Print`, `ErrorSuppress` | Scalar, coercion, stdout, and diagnostics helpers |
| `Variable`, `This`, `PreIncrement`, `PostIncrement`, `PreDecrement`, `PostDecrement`, `Assignment` | Variable load/store and assignment-expression helpers |
| `BinaryOp`, `InstanceOf`, `NullCoalesce`, `Pipe`, `Ternary`, `ShortTernary`, `Throw` | Operator, comparison, call-pipe, branch, and exception-aware expression helpers |
| `ArrayLiteral`, `ArrayLiteralAssoc`, `ArrayAccess`, `Spread`, `Match` | Indexed-array, associative-array, unpacking, string-indexing, and match-expression helpers |
| `FunctionCall`, `NamedArg`, `ClosureCall`, `ExprCall`, `Closure`, `FirstClassCallable` | Shared call-argument planner, closure wrappers, and callable dispatch helpers |
| `ConstRef`, `ClassConstant`, `ScopedConstantAccess`, `MagicConstant` | Compile-time constant and class-constant loading. `MagicConstant` should already be lowered by the frontend before codegen. |
| `NewObject`, `NewDynamic`, `NewScopedObject`, `NewDynamicObject`, `PropertyAccess`, `DynamicPropertyAccess`, `NullsafePropertyAccess`, `NullsafeDynamicPropertyAccess`, `StaticPropertyAccess`, `MethodCall`, `NullsafeMethodCall`, `StaticMethodCall` | Object allocation (including `new $var()` via `NewDynamic` and the internal runtime-class-string factory `NewDynamicObject`), property/member access, nullsafe chain lowering, vtable dispatch, and late-static-binding helpers |
| `PtrCast`, `BufferNew`, `Yield`, `YieldFrom` | Pointer/buffer extensions and generator state-machine lowering |

### Intrinsic Calls

Most method calls use the normal class metadata path: receiver evaluation, argument materialization, vtable or direct-method target selection, then a call to the emitted PHP method body. A small set of runtime-managed core objects cannot use the synthetic PHP stubs as their real implementation. For those, `src/intrinsics.rs` records an `IntrinsicCall` entry keyed by PHP class and method name, and `src/codegen/expr/objects/dispatch/intrinsic.rs` emits the direct runtime-helper call after the normal receiver and argument setup has already run.

Current intrinsic call sites cover `Fiber` instance/static APIs and the runtime-backed `Generator` method surface. User classes with the same method names are not affected because the lookup includes the resolved class name.

### Literals

```php
42        →  mov x0, #42
3.14      →  adrp x9, _float_0@PAGE  /  add x9, ...  /  ldr d0, [x9]
"hello"   →  adrp x1, _str_0@PAGE  /  add x1, ...  /  mov x2, #5
true      →  mov x0, #1
null      →  movz x0, #0xFFFE  /  movk x0, ...  (load null sentinel)
```

Large integers (> 65535 or negative) use `movz` + `movk` sequences. See [ARM64 Instruction Reference](arm64-instructions.md#loading-large-constants).

### The push/pop pattern for binary operations

Binary operations like `$a + $b` need both operands in registers simultaneously, but `emit_expr` uses the same registers for every expression. The solution: **push the left result onto the stack, evaluate the right, then pop the left back**.

```php
$a + $b
```

```asm
; Step 1: evaluate left ($a)
ldur x0, [x29, #-8]              ; x0 = $a

; Step 2: push left onto stack
str x0, [sp, #-16]!              ; save x0 to stack, decrement sp

; Step 3: evaluate right ($b)
ldur x0, [x29, #-16]             ; x0 = $b  (overwrites left!)

; Step 4: pop left back into a different register
ldr x1, [sp], #16                ; restore left into x1, increment sp

; Step 5: operate
add x0, x1, x0                   ; x0 = left + right
```

For strings (which use two registers), the push saves both `x1` and `x2`, and the pop restores them to `x3` and `x4`.

For floats, the push/pop uses `d0`/`d1`:

```asm
str d0, [sp, #-16]!              ; push left float
; ... evaluate right → d0 ...
ldr d1, [sp], #16                ; pop left float into d1
fadd d0, d1, d0                  ; d0 = left + right
```

### Comparison operators

Comparisons use `cmp` (integer) or `fcmp` (float) followed by `cset`:

```php
$x > 5
```

```asm
; ... push $x, evaluate 5 ...
cmp x1, x0                       ; compare left with right
cset x0, gt                      ; x0 = 1 if greater, 0 otherwise
```

The result is always `x0` with value 0 or 1 (`PhpType::Bool`).

### Short-circuit logical operators

`&&`, `||`, `and`, and `or` use **short-circuit evaluation** — the right side isn't evaluated if the left determines the result. `xor` is also a logical operator, but it evaluates both operands because exclusive OR needs both truthiness values.

```php
$a && $b
```

```asm
; evaluate $a
cmp x0, #0
b.eq _sc_end_1          ; if $a is falsy, skip $b entirely (result = 0)
; evaluate $b
cmp x0, #0
cset x0, ne             ; result = whether $b is truthy
_sc_end_1:
```

### String concatenation

The `.` operator calls the runtime's `__rt_concat`:

```php
"hello" . " world"
```

```asm
; push left string (x1, x2)
; evaluate right string → x1, x2
; pop left → x3, x4
; call concat
mov x3, ...              ; left ptr
mov x4, ...              ; left len
bl __rt_concat           ; result → x1 (ptr), x2 (len)
```

See [The Runtime](the-runtime.md) for how `__rt_concat` works.

### Bitwise operations

The bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`) operate on integers and emit single ARM64 instructions:

```php
$a & $b    →  and x0, x1, x0     // bitwise AND
$a | $b    →  orr x0, x1, x0     // bitwise OR
$a ^ $b    →  eor x0, x1, x0     // bitwise XOR
$a << $b   →  lsl x0, x1, x0     // logical shift left
$a >> $b   →  asr x0, x1, x0     // arithmetic shift right (preserves sign)
~$a        →  mvn x0, x0         // bitwise complement (one's complement)
```

Like other binary operations, bitwise ops use the push/pop pattern — evaluate left, push, evaluate right, pop left, apply operation.

### Spaceship operator

The spaceship operator (`<=>`) returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on the comparison result. It uses conditional select instructions:

```php
$a <=> $b
```

```asm
; ... push $a, evaluate $b ...
cmp x1, x0                      ; compare left with right
cset x0, gt                     ; x0 = 1 if left > right, else 0
csinv x0, x0, xzr, ge           ; if left < right: x0 = ~0 = -1 (all ones)
```

`csinv` (conditional select invert) inverts `xzr` (the zero register) to produce -1 when the condition is not met.

For floats, `fcmp` replaces `cmp`, but the same `cset`/`csinv` pattern applies.

### Array union

When both operands of `+` are arrays, codegen routes the expression to PHP array-union lowering instead of numeric addition. Indexed arrays call `__rt_array_union`, which clones the left operand and appends only the right-side numeric suffix whose keys are missing from the left. Associative arrays call `__rt_hash_union`, which clones the left hash, walks the right hash in insertion order, and inserts only keys that are absent from the clone. Mixed indexed/associative operands return a hash result: `__rt_array_hash_union` maps left indexed positions into integer hash keys before merging the right hash, while `__rt_hash_array_union` clones the left hash and probes right indexed positions as integer keys.

### Null coalescing operator

The `??` operator returns the left operand if it is non-null, otherwise the right:

```php
$x ?? "default"
```

```asm
; evaluate $x
; compare with null sentinel (0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFE)
b.ne _nc_done_1          ; if not null, keep left value
; evaluate "default"      ; otherwise, use right side
_nc_done_1:
```

The null check compares the value against the [null sentinel](memory-model.md). The operator is right-associative (`$a ?? $b ?? $c` = `$a ?? ($b ?? $c)`).

Null coalescing assignment is parsed as `$x = $x ?? expr`, but assignment lowering recognizes that exact shape and emits a conditional store:

```php
$x ??= "default";
```

The generated code loads `$x`, branches past the assignment when it is non-null, and evaluates/stores the right-hand side only on the null path. This preserves PHP's `??=` short-circuit behavior and avoids rewriting an already-owned heap value back into the same local slot.

### Pipe operator

PHP 8.5 `value |> callable` lowers through `src/codegen/expr/calls/pipe.rs`.
`emit_expr()` first stores the left-hand value into a hidden local slot so the
left side is observably evaluated before the callable target. It then builds a
synthetic one-argument call using that hidden local as the single positional
argument.

The pipe lowering delegates to the existing call paths whenever possible:
first-class function targets become `FunctionCall`, first-class static method
targets become `StaticMethodCall`, first-class instance method targets become
`MethodCall`, local callable variables become `ClosureCall`, and other callable
expressions become `ExprCall`. Argument planning, ABI materialization,
ownership, and diagnostics therefore stay aligned with ordinary calls.

### Error-control operator

The `@` operator lowers to a scoped runtime diagnostic-suppression pair:

1. Call `__rt_diag_push_suppression`
2. Evaluate the operand normally
3. Preserve the operand result in the appropriate ABI result shape
4. Call `__rt_diag_pop_suppression`
5. Restore the operand result

The exception handler frame also snapshots the current suppression depth before `setjmp()` and restores it after a `longjmp()` into catch dispatch. That prevents a thrown expression inside `@` from leaking warning suppression into later code.

### Nullsafe operator

The `?->` operator lowers nullable receivers through the boxed mixed path used by nullable and union storage. Codegen flattens postfix chains that contain a nullsafe segment, evaluates the base once, and branches to a shared boxed-`null` result when a nullsafe receiver is null. That branch skips the rest of the chain, including later ordinary `->` segments, array indexes, method arguments, and callable arguments. If an ordinary segment later receives a real null value from the non-short-circuited path, it still follows PHP's warning or fatal behavior.

### Type coercions

When types need to match (e.g., int + float), the codegen inserts conversion instructions:

```asm
scvtf d0, x0             ; convert signed integer (x0) → double (d0)
fcvtzs x0, d0            ; convert double (d0) → signed integer (x0)
```

The `.` (concat) operator also coerces non-strings:
- `Int` → calls `__rt_itoa` to get a string
- `Float` → calls `__rt_ftoa`
- `Bool true` → string "1"
- `Bool false` / `Null` → empty string (length 0)

### Constant references

```php
const MAX = 100;
echo MAX;
```

Constants declared with `const` or `define()` are resolved at compile time. When the codegen encounters a `ConstRef`, it looks up the constant's value and emits it as a literal — `mov x0, #100` for an integer, or loads a string label from the data section. `define()` call sites still emit a per-constant runtime seen flag so the call returns `true` only for the first runtime definition and returns `false` with a suppressible warning on duplicate attempts.

Enum cases reuse the same idea, but through enum metadata instead of scalar constants: parser output uses `ExprKind::ScopedConstantAccess` for `Color::Red`, and codegen detects enum receivers to load the canonical enum-case symbol emitted in runtime data. Helper builtins such as `Enum::from()` / `Enum::tryFrom()` lower through the checker/codegen enum tables carried in `Context`; a missing `Enum::from()` value constructs a catchable `ValueError` with the PHP-compatible backing-value message.

### Pointer values and casts

Pointer expressions are carried in `x0` as plain 64-bit addresses:

- `ptr($var)` computes the address of a stack or global slot and returns it in `x0`
- `ptr_null()` loads the zero address
- `ptr_cast<T>($p)` only changes the static type tag seen by the checker, so codegen emits the inner expression and leaves the address unchanged
- Pointer printing routes through `__rt_ptoa`, which formats the address as a `0x...` string before writing

### Buffer allocation and packed hot-path access

`buffer_new<T>(len)` lowers directly from `ExprKind::BufferNew`: codegen evaluates the element count, loads the checked element stride from the type metadata, and calls `__rt_buffer_new`. The resulting pointer in `x0` references a contiguous `[length][stride][payload...]` block rather than a PHP array/hash structure.

When `T` is a scalar POD type, reads and writes use direct address arithmetic from the buffer base plus `index * stride`. When `T` is a `packed class`, codegen combines the buffer element stride with the field offset from `packed_classes` metadata and emits direct typed loads/stores into the packed payload.

### Function calls

```php
my_func($a, $b, $c)
```

1. Evaluate each argument and push results onto the stack
2. Pop arguments into the correct ABI registers (`x0`-`x7` for ints, `d0`-`d7` for floats, two registers per string)
3. If a heap-backed argument is being borrowed from an existing owner (for example a local variable or container read), retain it before passing it to the callee
4. `bl _fn_my_func` — branch with link (saves return address)
5. Result is in `x0`/`d0`/`x1`+`x2` depending on return type

Named-argument calls split evaluation order from ABI order. `src/codegen/expr/calls/args.rs` evaluates source arguments left-to-right, stores any out-of-order values in temporary slots, validates spread prefixes after later named expressions have run, then materializes the final parameter list in ABI order. Spread prefixes before named arguments are evaluated once; multiple prefix spreads are combined before runtime length/overwrite checks, and too-short positional spreads for required parameters fail instead of reading beyond the array payload. Runtime associative-array spreads are dynamic named providers: they look up string keys by parameter name, fall back to numeric keys for positional slots, and let the per-parameter missing/default branch decide whether a required value is present. Built-in and extern named calls use the same source-order pre-evaluation step before their normalized positional emitters run; mutating built-ins mark their target parameter as ref-like so pre-evaluation does not redirect writes into a temporary. Extern calls preserve PHP source evaluation order first and only then load C ABI registers.

## Closure codegen

### Anonymous functions and arrow functions

Closures (`function($x) { ... }`) and arrow functions (`fn($x) => ...`) are compiled as separate labeled functions, similar to user-defined functions. The key difference is **deferred emission** — the closure body is not emitted inline. Instead:

1. **At the closure expression site**: the codegen generates a unique entry label (e.g., `_closure_1`), creates a static callable descriptor in `.data`, and loads the descriptor address into `x0`. The descriptor includes side records for signature/default/by-reference/variadic metadata, capture and hidden-parameter bindings, and invocation shape. The descriptor pointer is then stored in the variable's stack slot as a `Callable` (8 bytes).

2. **The body is deferred**: the closure's parameter list, body statements, captured variables, and label are pushed onto `ctx.deferred_closures`. This avoids emitting function code in the middle of the current function's instruction stream.

3. **After `_main`**: all deferred closures are emitted as standalone labeled functions (prologue, body, epilogue), just like user-defined functions.

### `use` captures

Closures can capture variables from the enclosing scope via `use ($var1, $var2)`:

```php
$greeting = "Hello";
$fn = function($name) use ($greeting) {
    echo $greeting . " " . $name;
};
```

Only explicit `use (...)` captures are stored in the AST and forwarded as hidden closure arguments. Arrow functions are still parsed as closures, but they use `is_arrow = true` with an empty `captures` list.

The AST stores captured variable names in the `captures` field of the `Closure` expression. At the call site, captured variables are passed as **extra arguments** after the explicit arguments:

1. **At the closure expression site**: the captured variable names and types are recorded in `ctx.closure_captures` alongside the deferred closure.
2. **At the call site** (`$fn("World")`): the codegen looks up the captured variables, evaluates them from the caller's scope, and passes them as additional arguments after the explicit ones.
3. **In the closure body**: the captured values arrive as extra parameters and are stored in local stack slots, making them accessible like regular local variables.

This means captures are passed **by value** — modifying a captured variable inside the closure does not affect the outer scope (matching PHP semantics).

### Closure calls

When a closure variable is called (`$fn(1, 2)`), the codegen:

1. Evaluates each argument and pushes results onto the stack
2. Loads the closure descriptor from the variable's stack slot into `x9`
3. Loads the native entry address from the descriptor's entry slot
4. Pushes `x9` temporarily while popping arguments into ABI registers
5. Pops `x9` back and calls `blr x9` — an indirect branch through a register

`blr` (Branch with Link to Register) is like `bl` but the target address comes from a register rather than a label. This is what makes closures work — the compiler doesn't know at compile time which function will be called, so it uses an indirect jump.

### Closures as callback arguments

Built-in functions like `array_map`, `array_filter`, `array_reduce`, `array_walk`, `usort`, `uksort`, `uasort`, and `preg_replace_callback` accept callback values. PHP callable storage carries a descriptor pointer; callback runtimes receive the native entry loaded from that descriptor plus an optional environment pointer, then call the entry via `blr`.

For captured closures passed through callback runtimes such as `array_map`, `array_filter`, `array_reduce`, `array_walk`, `usort`, `uksort`, `uasort`, and `preg_replace_callback`, codegen builds a temporary callback environment containing the original entry address plus its hidden `use (...)` values. The runtime passes that environment to a generated callback wrapper, and the wrapper re-materializes the original visible arguments plus hidden captures before calling the closure. `array_map()`, `array_filter()`, `array_reduce()`, `array_walk()`, `usort()`, `uksort()`, `uasort()`, and `preg_replace_callback()` route descriptor-valued callable variables and `callable` parameters through descriptor-backed callback wrappers, so stored closure captures and first-class-callable receiver environments come from the descriptor rather than from source locals that may have changed. Those callback runtimes also select descriptor cases for runtime callable-array variables such as `[$object, $method]` or `[$class, $method]`, then build the same descriptor callback environment after the runtime receiver/class and method strings match a public method. These runtimes can also route branch-shaped captured callable expressions through descriptor-backed callback wrappers: the environment stores the selected descriptor, the wrapper boxes visible arguments into a temporary Mixed argument array, invokes the descriptor's uniform invoker, casts or discards the boxed result for the callback runtime, and preserves runtime-loop callee-saved registers around the generated invoker. `CallbackFilterIterator` and `RecursiveCallbackFilterIterator` use a heap-backed variant of that descriptor environment so branch-selected captured descriptors and runtime-selected callable-array variable or literal descriptors stay attached to the iterator object and recursive child filters. `iterator_apply()` uses the same uniform descriptor invoker for branch-shaped captured callbacks and runtime-selected callable-array variables, with its callback-argument array evaluated once before the iterator loop and reused for each invocation. String-producing descriptor-backed `array_map()` and `preg_replace_callback()` calls detach string results from boxed Mixed values before releasing the invoker result. `call_user_func()` and `call_user_func_array()` can dispatch through callable descriptors directly: closure and first-class-callable values with hidden context allocate runtime descriptor copies whose static header is followed by 16-byte capture slots. Dynamic callback dispatch uses `codegen::callable_dispatch` cases carrying descriptor labels with PHP-visible names, signature metadata, defaults, by-reference flags, variadic metadata, and hidden captures. Descriptor-selected callbacks compare entry slots with user functions and emitted closure/FCC wrappers; when the matched case exposes an invoker, the callsite switches back to the actual descriptor and calls the uniform wrapper. Runtime string-name callbacks compare case-insensitively against user-function, extern-wrapper, builtin-wrapper, and static-method names, materialize the matched descriptor, then call the descriptor's uniform invoker wrapper. Compile-time static-method callable arrays also use static-method descriptors for direct variable and literal calls, `call_user_func()` calls, and `call_user_func_array()` calls, including associative variadic tails and positional prefixes before indexed spreads. Direct instance-method callable-array variable calls read the receiver from the stored callable array slot, while direct literal calls evaluate the receiver before visible call arguments; both then build the receiver-prefixed descriptor argument container. Direct invokable-object variable calls build the same receiver-prefixed descriptor argument container from the local object and use the object-invoke invocation shape. Receiver-bound `call_user_func()` calls with one spread source pass that source container through the receiver-prefix normalizer and descriptor invoker instead of falling back to direct method emission. Receiver-bound calls with positional prefixes followed by indexed spreads build a raw Mixed-slot indexed argument array, prepend the receiver as descriptor slot zero, append the prefix values, merge cloned indexed spread tails, and then let the descriptor normalizer clone and box that container for invocation. Direct branch-selected expression calls that combine spread prefixes with named arguments build a temporary Mixed hash from the source-order positional prefix plus named suffix entries, while direct calls whose only argument segment is one spread source pass that source container to the same descriptor invoker. Direct descriptor calls with positional prefixes followed by indexed spreads use the same raw Mixed-slot indexed container builder, without adding a receiver slot. Indirect calls on callable variables or array elements fall back to the descriptor invoker whenever the local callsite no longer has a trustworthy static signature or capture list; variable arguments in indexed containers, positional prefixes before indexed spreads, and associative named-argument hashes are encoded as ref-cell markers so the generated invoker can apply runtime by-reference flags from the descriptor or dereference the same marker for by-value parameters. The invoker receives `(descriptor, boxed argument container)`, loads the entry slot itself, reloads hidden captures from the descriptor when present, branches on the boxed container tag for indexed-array or associative-hash materialization, unboxes boxed array/hash payloads for declared array parameters, applies the matched signature, and returns a boxed `mixed`. `call_user_func_array()` descriptor invokers receive a cloned temporary argument container widened to boxed `Mixed`, so wrappers are shared by callable signature instead of by the caller's static element type or argument-array shape. When `call_user_func_array()` targets a by-reference callback and receives a literal argument array, codegen passes frame-slot addresses for variable elements in by-reference positions instead of loading array payload values.

Extern `callable` parameters that receive descriptor values use a separate C-ABI trampoline path. Codegen emits one mutable descriptor slot and one trampoline symbol per callsite; the extern call stores the retained descriptor in that slot, passes the trampoline address to C, and the trampoline boxes incoming scalar/pointer callback arguments before calling the descriptor invoker. This lets C APIs with only a raw function-pointer slot retain closure captures, first-class method receivers, and branch-selected descriptor state without changing the C signature.

First-class callable wrappers reuse this hidden argument path when the callable target carries context. `$obj->method(...)` records the receiver as a hidden capture; non-local receiver expressions are evaluated once into a hidden temporary before wrapper creation. `static::method(...)` records the forwarded called-class id, or `$this` in an instance method, so late static binding is preserved for direct callable calls and for callback paths that forward an environment.

## Generator codegen

**Files:** `src/codegen/functions/generator/`, `src/codegen/runtime/generators/`, `src/codegen/expr/objects/dispatch/vtable.rs`

A function or closure body that contains `yield` does not emit as an ordinary function body. Codegen emits two symbols:

1. `_fn_<name>` — a wrapper that allocates a heap `GeneratorFrame`, stamps it as the built-in `Generator` object, copies supported scalar parameters/captures into frame slots, zeroes local slots, and returns the frame pointer.
2. `_fn_<name>__resume` — a state-machine entry point. State `0` enters the body; each yield gets a numbered resume label. At a yield, the resume function boxes the key/value into Mixed cells, replaces the frame's last key/value slots, stores the next state index, and returns to the caller.

Generator closures reuse the same path as ordinary deferred closures, but their hidden `use (...)` captures are copied into the generator frame alongside visible parameters. `yield from` stores the active inner generator in the frame's `delegated_iter` slot and resumes it through the same `__rt_gen_*` runtime helpers used by user-visible `Generator` methods.

The generated `Generator` object has a custom payload layout rather than ordinary PHP properties. Method dispatch for `current`, `key`, `valid`, `next`, `rewind`, `send`, `throw`, and `getReturn` is intercepted before vtable lookup and routed directly to `__rt_gen_*`. Both AArch64 and Linux `x86_64` follow the same high-level state-machine model; the wrapper, resume dispatcher, and runtime helper emitters select target-specific instruction sequences internally.

## Fiber codegen

**Files:** `src/codegen/expr/objects/allocation.rs`, `src/codegen/expr/objects/dispatch/`, `src/codegen/expr/objects/fiber_callable.rs`, `src/codegen/expr/objects/fiber_wrapper.rs`, `src/codegen/functions/fiber_wrapper.rs`, `src/codegen/runtime/fibers/`

`Fiber` is a built-in class, but codegen does not lower it through the ordinary object constructor and method-dispatch path. `new Fiber($callable)` is intercepted, materializes raw string callbacks, callable-array, and invokable-object shapes into callable descriptors, then delegates to `__rt_fiber_construct`, which allocates the larger runtime-managed Fiber object, creates its guarded native stack, stores the callable descriptor pointer, and records the generated wrapper label that adapts Fiber start values to the callback ABI. Stored instance-method callable arrays bind the receiver from `$callback[0]` into a descriptor capture so later writes to the source callable variable cannot change the Fiber body. Inline receiver expressions, invokable-object expressions, and runtime-selected callable-array variables or literals are evaluated once at construction time before the receiver is stored in the descriptor.

Each accepted Fiber callback gets a deferred entry wrapper emitted next to deferred closure bodies. The wrapper runs on the Fiber stack, reloads boxed `start()` values from `start_args[0..6]`, unboxes them to the callback's declared parameter types, reloads hidden captures or method receivers from the stored callable descriptor's runtime capture slots, loads the original entry from that descriptor, calls it with normal ABI materialization, and boxes the terminal return value back to `mixed`.

Instance and static Fiber methods are also intercepted:

- `$fiber->start(...)` spills up to seven boxed `mixed` start arguments into the Fiber object before calling `__rt_fiber_start`; callable captures and receivers are already stored in the descriptor and are not overwritten by start arguments.
- `$fiber->resume($value)`, `$fiber->throw($exception)`, `$fiber->getReturn()`, and the state predicates branch directly to their `__rt_fiber_*` runtime helpers.
- `Fiber::suspend($value)` and `Fiber::getCurrent()` lower to runtime helper calls instead of ordinary static method dispatch.

Both AArch64 and Linux `x86_64` use the same high-level lowering. The final register moves, temporary-stack layout, direct/indirect calls, and frame setup go through the ABI module so the Fiber wrapper follows each target's calling convention rather than hardcoding ARM64 register names in shared code.

## Associative array codegen

Associative arrays use a hash table stored on the heap. The codegen differs from indexed arrays at every level:

### Literal creation

```php
$m = ["name" => "Alice", "age" => "30"];
```

1. Call `__rt_hash_new` with initial capacity and value type tag → `x0` = hash table pointer
2. For each key-value pair: evaluate key (string → `x1`/`x2`), evaluate value, call `__rt_hash_set`

### Access

```php
$m["name"]
```

1. Save hash table pointer on stack
2. Evaluate key expression → `x1`/`x2` (string)
3. Call `__rt_hash_get` → `x0` = found (0/1), `x1` = value_lo, `x2` = value_hi, `x3` = per-entry value tag
4. Move result to standard registers based on value type; if the static result is `Mixed`, box the payload into a heap cell first

### Functions on associative arrays

Builtin functions like `array_key_exists`, `in_array`, `array_keys`, `array_values` dispatch on the array type at compile time:
- `PhpType::Array` → use indexed runtime routines (e.g., bounds check, linear scan)
- `PhpType::AssocArray` → use hash table routines (e.g., `__rt_hash_get`, `__rt_hash_iter_next`)

### `foreach` over associative arrays

When `foreach` iterates a `PhpType::AssocArray`, the lowering differs from indexed arrays:

1. Save the hash pointer and an iteration cursor on the stack (`0` means "start from header.head")
2. Call `__rt_hash_iter_next`
3. If `x0 == -1`, exit the loop
4. Otherwise save the returned cursor, store `x1`/`x2` into the optional key variable, and store `x3`/`x4`/`x5` into the value variable according to the inferred element type; `Mixed` loop variables reuse or allocate boxed mixed cells as needed
5. Emit the loop body, then branch back to the iterator call

This preserves PHP-style insertion order because `__rt_hash_iter_next` walks the hash table's linked insertion-order chain rather than scanning physical buckets.

See [The Runtime](the-runtime.md) for details on hash table routines and [Memory Model](memory-model.md) for the hash table memory layout.

## String indexing codegen

The same `ArrayAccess` AST node also covers string indexing such as `$str[1]` or `$str[-1]`. In `src/codegen/expr/arrays.rs`, `emit_array_access()` checks for `PhpType::Str` and lowers the operation inline:

1. Save the string pointer/length while evaluating the index expression
2. Adjust negative indices relative to the end of the string
3. Clamp offsets below `-len` to the start and offsets past the end to the end
4. Advance the string pointer to the selected byte
5. Return either a one-character string (`x1` + `x2 = 1`) or an empty string when the offset is out of bounds

So the behavior is slice-like, but it does not call `substr()` or a dedicated runtime helper.

## Statement codegen

**Files:** `src/codegen/stmt.rs`, `src/codegen/stmt/`

`emit_stmt()` is similarly split across focused helpers under `stmt/`: assignment/storage logic, array statements, include-once guards, and control-flow lowering (`branching`, `foreach`, `loops`) now live outside the thin top-level dispatcher. `stmt/includes.rs` emits the `.comm` flag and branch sequence used by resolver-generated `IncludeOnceMark` and `IncludeOnceGuard` nodes, plus the active-variant store used when an include point loads a hidden function implementation. Small shared statement-side policies such as borrowed-result retention, local-slot ownership updates, static-init guards, and indexed-array metadata stamping now sit in `stmt/helpers.rs` instead of bloating `stmt.rs` itself. Storage lowering is now split too: `stmt/storage.rs` is just a boundary, with `storage/locals.rs` handling ordinary global/static symbol access and `storage/extern_globals.rs` owning extern-global load/store conventions. Assignment lowering is also split one level deeper: `stmt/assignments/locals.rs` handles plain local/global/ref writes, while `stmt/assignments/properties.rs` now orchestrates property writes across `properties/target.rs`, `magic_set.rs`, and `storage.rs`. Array-index writes follow the same pattern now: `stmt/arrays/assign.rs` is just a dispatcher, while `stmt/arrays/assign/buffer.rs` and `assoc.rs` isolate the non-indexed-container paths, and `stmt/arrays/assign/indexed.rs` now orchestrates the indexed-array write across `indexed/prepare.rs`, `normalize.rs`, `store.rs`, and `extend.rs`. Branching lowering now follows that same shape too: `stmt/control_flow/branching.rs` is just a boundary, while `branching/if_stmt.rs` and `branching/switch_stmt.rs` own the distinct lowering paths. Exception lowering follows the same structure: `stmt/control_flow/exceptions.rs` orchestrates the high-level try/catch/finally flow, while `exceptions/handlers.rs`, `catches.rs`, and `finally.rs` own the lower-level handler stack, catch matching, and pending-action/finally dispatch mechanics. Loop lowering is split too: `stmt/control_flow/loops.rs` is now just a boundary, with `loops/iterative.rs` handling `for`/`while`/`do...while` and `loops/exits.rs` owning `break`/`continue`/`return`. `foreach` lowering now follows the same pattern: `stmt/control_flow/foreach.rs` dispatches between `foreach/indexed.rs`, `foreach/assoc.rs`, and `foreach/iterator.rs` for arrays, hashes, `Iterator`, `IteratorAggregate`, and object-backed `iterable` values.

### Statement AST dispatch coverage

The statement dispatcher maps `StmtKind` variants to storage, control-flow,
declaration, include, or extension paths:

| Variants | Lowering path |
|---|---|
| `Echo`, `ExprStmt`, `Throw`, `Synthetic` | Direct statement helpers, expression dispatch, exception throw, or already-lowered statement sequences |
| `Assign`, `RefAssign`, `TypedAssign`, `ArrayAssign`, `NestedArrayAssign`, `ArrayPush`, `ListUnpack`, `PropertyAssign`, `StaticPropertyAssign`, `PropertyArrayPush`, `PropertyArrayAssign`, `StaticPropertyArrayPush`, `StaticPropertyArrayAssign` | Local/global/static storage, reference aliasing, array storage, destructuring, and property storage helpers |
| `If`, `IfDef`, `While`, `DoWhile`, `For`, `Foreach`, `Switch`, `Try`, `Break`, `Continue`, `Return` | Branching, compile-time conditional lowering, loops, foreach dispatch, switch lowering, exception/finally control flow, loop exits, and return epilogues |
| `Include`, `IncludeOnceMark`, `IncludeOnceGuard`, `FunctionVariantGroup`, `FunctionVariantMark` | Resolver-produced include guards and include-loaded function variant activation |
| `NamespaceDecl`, `NamespaceBlock`, `UseDecl`, `ConstDecl` | Mostly frontend/name-resolution artifacts; constants remain available through the codegen context |
| `FunctionDecl`, `ClassDecl`, `EnumDecl`, `InterfaceDecl`, `TraitDecl`, `PackedClassDecl` | Deferred function/method emission and metadata-driven class, enum, interface, trait, and packed-record setup |
| `Global`, `StaticVar` | Symbol-backed local aliases and per-function static storage |
| `ExternFunctionDecl`, `ExternClassDecl`, `ExternGlobalDecl` | Registration-only at statement emission; expression/call lowering uses the collected FFI metadata |

### Echo and print

```php
echo $x;
echo "a", "b";
$status = print $x;
```

1. Evaluate each `echo` expression in source order → result in registers
2. Check for null/false (skip printing if so — matches PHP behavior where `echo false` prints nothing)
3. Call `emit_write_stdout()` from the [ABI module](#the-abi-module)

`print` expressions reuse the same stdout helper, then write integer `1` into
the expression result register so the value can be assigned, concatenated, or
passed into another expression.

### Assignment

```php
$x = expr;
```

1. Evaluate expression
2. If the result is a borrowed heap value, retain it before the local slot becomes a new owner
3. Release the previous owned heap value from `$x` when overwriting a heap-backed slot
4. `emit_store()` — write result to `$x`'s stack slot and classify the local slot as `Owned` for heap-backed types

Typed local declarations such as `int $x = 42;` or `buffer<int> $xs = buffer_new<int>(8);` share the same storage path after the checker has resolved `StmtKind::TypedAssign` into a concrete `PhpType`.

### Constant declaration

```php
const MAX = 100;
```

`ConstDecl` registers a compile-time constant. The value is stored in the codegen context and substituted directly wherever the constant is referenced via `ConstRef`. No runtime storage or stack allocation is needed.

### Global variables

```php
$x = 10;
function inc() {
    global $x;
    $x++;
}
```

The `global` statement inside a function declares that a variable refers to global storage rather than a local stack slot. The codegen uses BSS-allocated storage (`_gvar_NAME`, 16 bytes each) for global variables:

1. At `global $x;`: the variable is marked as global in the context. The current value is loaded from `_gvar_x` into the local stack slot.
   The local view is tracked as a borrowed alias of the BSS-backed owner.
2. On assignment to a global variable: the codegen writes to the BSS storage (`_gvar_x`) via `adrp`/`add`/`str` instead of (or in addition to) the local stack slot.
3. In `_main`: when the main scope assigns to a variable that any function declares as `global`, the value is also written to `_gvar_NAME` so that functions can read it.

### Extern declarations

`ExternFunctionDecl`, `ExternClassDecl`, and `ExternGlobalDecl` are registration-only statements during codegen. Their metadata has already been collected by the type checker and copied into `Context`, so `emit_stmt()` treats the declarations themselves as no-ops while later expression codegen uses the recorded FFI data.

Extern globals are loaded through GOT-relative addressing (`adrp ...@GOTPAGE` / `ldr ...@GOTPAGEOFF`) instead of ordinary stack or BSS slots.

### Static variables

```php
function counter() {
    static $count = 0;
    $count++;
    echo $count;
}
```

Static variables persist their value across function calls. Each static variable gets two BSS slots:

- `_static_FUNC_VAR` (16 bytes) — stores the persisted value
- `_static_FUNC_VAR_init` (8 bytes) — initialization flag (0 = not yet initialized)

The codegen for `static $count = 0;`:

1. Check the init flag — if already initialized, skip to loading the persisted value
2. If not initialized: evaluate the init expression, store to the BSS slot, set the init flag to 1
3. Load the persisted value into the local stack slot

That per-call local slot is tracked as `Borrowed`; the persisted static storage remains the long-lived owner.

At function epilogue, variables marked as static are written back to their BSS storage.

### Static properties

Static properties use one global 16-byte storage slot per effective declaring class property:

- `_static_prop_CLASS_PROP` stores the current value payload
- inherited static properties point back to the declaring class slot until a subclass redeclares the property
- redeclared static properties get a separate subclass slot

At program startup, `_main` evaluates static property defaults and stores them into these slots before user statements run. Reads such as `ClassName::$count` load directly from the resolved symbol, and assignments store the new result back to the same symbol after type coercion and previous-value release for heap-backed values. `static::$count` uses the forwarded called-class id (or `$this` in instance methods) to select a redeclared descendant slot at runtime; if that late-bound slot is private and inaccessible from the current method scope, generated code emits a fatal private-static-property diagnostic.

### List unpacking

```php
[$a, $b, $c] = [10, 20, 30];
```

Simple local positional destructuring remains a `ListUnpack` statement. The codegen:

1. Evaluates the right-hand side expression (an array)
2. Saves the array pointer on the stack
3. For each variable in the list: loads the element at the corresponding index from the array, stores it into the variable's stack slot, and marks heap-backed elements as borrowed aliases of the source container

Richer PHP destructuring patterns are lowered by the parser into ordinary synthetic assignments before checking and codegen. Skipped entries simply emit no assignment, keyed entries become array reads with the given key, nested patterns bind a hidden temporary for the nested source array, and non-local targets reuse the same assignment emitters as `$arr[$i] = ...`, `$arr[] = ...`, `$obj->prop = ...`, and static-property writes.

### If / Elseif / Else

```php
if ($cond1) { body1 } elseif ($cond2) { body2 } else { body3 }
```

```asm
; evaluate $cond1
cmp x0, #0
b.eq _elseif_1           ; skip to next branch if falsy

; body1
b _end_if_1               ; done — skip all remaining branches

_elseif_1:
; evaluate $cond2
cmp x0, #0
b.eq _else_1

; body2
b _end_if_1

_else_1:
; body3

_end_if_1:
```

### While loop

```php
while ($cond) { body }
```

```asm
_while_1:                  ; ← continue jumps here
; evaluate $cond
cmp x0, #0
b.eq _end_while_1         ; exit if falsy ← break jumps here

; body
b _while_1                 ; loop back

_end_while_1:
```

### For loop

```php
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) { body }
```

```asm
; emit init ($i = 0)

_for_1:
; evaluate condition ($i < 10)
cmp x0, #0
b.eq _end_for_1

; body

_for_cont_1:               ; ← continue jumps here
; emit update ($i++)
b _for_1

_end_for_1:                 ; ← break jumps here
```

### Foreach

```php
foreach ($arr as $v) { body }
```

For indexed arrays:

1. Save array pointer, length, and index counter on the stack (3 × 16-byte slots)
2. Loop: load element at current index, unbox through the runtime `value_type` tag when the static element type is `Mixed`, store to `$v`, and classify heap-backed loop variables as borrowed aliases of the iterated container
3. Branch back to condition check
4. Cleanup: deallocate the 48 bytes

For associative arrays, see [Associative array codegen](#associative-array-codegen): the loop stores a hash pointer plus cursor, then advances with `__rt_hash_iter_next`.

For `Iterator` objects, codegen parks the receiver in a 16-byte stack slot, dispatches `rewind()`, then drives the loop through `valid()`, `key()`, `current()`, and `next()`. Keys and values are boxed into `Mixed` because the concrete runtime payload can vary per iterator implementation. `IteratorAggregate` values dispatch `getIterator()` first, then reuse the same iterator loop path. Values typed as `iterable` branch through runtime heap-kind and interface metadata so arrays, direct `Iterator` objects, and aggregate-backed objects select the correct lowering.

Before the first `valid()` call, foreach target slots are normalized to boxed `Mixed`. That keeps empty iterators compatible with PHP: existing target variables keep a valid mixed cell, fresh loop variables remain null-like, and receiver aliases stay live until loop cleanup.

### Break / Continue

`break` emits a `b` (unconditional jump) to the selected loop/switch end label.
`continue` emits a `b` to the selected continue label (the condition check for
`while`, the update for `for`, or the switch end label for PHP-style
`continue` inside `switch`).

The `loop_stack` in the Context tracks labels for nested loops and switches.
Multi-level forms such as `break 2;` and `continue 2;` index back through that
stack. Each `LoopLabels` entry also carries an `sp_adjust` field so multi-level
exits and returns can undo any skipped switch-subject temporary stack slots
before jumping to the selected target or shared function epilogue. If the exit
crosses a `finally`, codegen records the selected target and runs the active
`finally` chain before resuming the branch.

The type checker rejects `break` / `continue` that would jump out of a
`finally` body, so codegen only has to route legal exits from protected `try` or
`catch` bodies through `finally_stack`.

### Exceptions and `finally`

Exception lowering lives in `src/codegen/stmt/control_flow/exceptions.rs`. The basic strategy is:

1. Evaluate the thrown object and publish it to `_exc_value`
2. Call `__rt_throw_current`, which unwinds activation records and `longjmp`s into the nearest handler
3. For `try`, emit a `_setjmp` resume point plus a linked handler record in `_exc_handler_top`
4. Test each catch target by class id or interface id through `__rt_exception_matches`
5. Route `return`, `break`, `continue`, and rethrow through `finally_stack` so every enclosing `finally` runs before control leaves the protected region. The checker rejects `break` / `continue` that would originate inside a `finally` and target an outer loop/switch.

This means `finally` is part of ordinary control-flow lowering, not a separate runtime pass. The runtime only unwinds frames and chooses the landing pad; the compiler-generated labels still decide whether execution resumes in a matching `catch`, in a `finally`, or in an outer handler.

### Switch

```php
switch ($x) {
    case 1: echo "one"; break;
    case 2: echo "two"; break;
    default: echo "other"; break;
}
```

1. Evaluate the subject expression once and push the result onto the stack
2. For each case: pop subject, evaluate case value, compare (`cmp` + `b.ne` for integers, `bl __rt_str_eq` for strings)
3. If match: emit case body, which may contain `break` (jump to end label) or fall through to next case
4. Default case: emit body unconditionally
5. End label after all cases

The switch uses the loop stack so that `break` inside a case body jumps to the switch end label rather than an enclosing loop.

### Match expression

Match is an expression (returns a value), not a statement. It uses strict comparison (`===`) and has no fall-through:

```php
$result = match($x) {
    1 => "one",
    2 => "two",
    default => "other",
};
```

1. Evaluate subject, push onto stack
2. For each arm: compare subject with each pattern in the arm's pattern list
3. If any pattern matches: evaluate the arm's result expression, jump to end
4. Default arm: evaluate result unconditionally
5. Result is left in standard registers (`x0`, `d0`, or `x1`/`x2`)

## Class codegen

### Object allocation (`new ClassName(...)`)

When the codegen encounters a `NewObject` expression:

1. **Calculate object size**: `8 + (num_properties × 16) + dyn_props_slot` — 8 bytes for the class ID, 16 bytes per property across the full inherited layout, plus one optional 8-byte slot for the dynamic-property hash pointer when the class carries `#[\AllowDynamicProperties]`
2. **Allocate heap memory**: call `__rt_heap_alloc` with the calculated size
3. **Zero-initialize**: clear all property slots to zero
4. **Store class ID**: write the class identifier at offset 0
5. **Apply defaults**: for properties with default values, evaluate and store them at their fixed offsets
6. **Call constructor**: if the class exposes `__construct`, pass the new object pointer as `x0` (`$this`) followed by the constructor arguments, then branch to the implementation label recorded in class metadata (which may come from an inherited constructor)

Classes declared with the PHP 8.2 `#[\AllowDynamicProperties]` attribute reserve a trailing per-object hash slot so undeclared property writes/reads can be routed through a runtime side table instead of failing at compile time.

The result is the object pointer in `x0`.

### Attribute reflection objects

`new ReflectionClass(...)`, `new ReflectionMethod(...)`, and `new ReflectionProperty(...)` are intercepted by `src/codegen/expr/objects/reflection.rs` instead of relying on ordinary user-defined constructor bodies. The type checker has already forced their class/member arguments to compile-time strings after normal call-argument planning, so codegen can look up the target `ClassInfo` directly and populate the private `__attrs` slot with a freshly built `array<ReflectionAttribute>`.

`src/codegen/reflection.rs` owns the shared materialization path. It allocates each synthetic `ReflectionAttribute`, writes the resolved `__name`, builds the `array<mixed>` `__args` payload from supported literal attribute arguments, and stores a deterministic `__factory` id. `ReflectionAttribute::newInstance()` is then generated in `src/codegen/class_methods.rs` as a branch table over those factory ids; each branch constructs the real attribute class with the captured literal args, and the fallback returns `null` when no defined attribute class can be materialized.

The `_class_attribute_*` runtime data tables still emit class-level attribute metadata from the same `ClassInfo` fields, but the supported Reflection owner constructors are compile-time materialized and do not perform runtime name lookups for classes, methods, or properties.

### Type checks (`$obj instanceof ClassName`)

`ExprKind::InstanceOf` evaluates the left-hand side exactly once, materializes the target class or interface id from emitted metadata, and returns a boolean in `x0`. Direct object values call `__rt_exception_matches`, the same metadata matcher used by exception catch lowering, so inherited classes and implemented interfaces are handled through the same parent-id and class-interface tables.

For named targets, when the left-hand side is lowered as `Mixed` or `Union`, codegen calls `__rt_mixed_instanceof` instead. That helper unwraps nested mixed boxes, returns `false` for scalar, array, null, and unknown payload tags, and only forwards object payloads into `__rt_exception_matches`. This keeps nullable and union object checks PHP-compatible without treating the boxed mixed cell itself as an object pointer.

Named targets are resolved before codegen. Named classes/interfaces become concrete metadata ids, `self` and `parent` resolve in the current lexical class context, and `static` uses the forwarded called-class id for late static binding. Dynamic targets are evaluated and validated after the left-hand side is evaluated; string targets are resolved through emitted case-insensitive class/interface name metadata, object targets load the target object's runtime class id, invalid target payloads branch to a fatal runtime diagnostic, and non-object left-hand payloads become `false` after that validation step.

### Property access (`$obj->prop`)

Property access usually uses fixed offsets computed at compile time from `ClassInfo.property_offsets`:

```asm
; $obj->prop where prop resolved to offset 24
ldur x0, [x29, #-offset]            ; load object pointer
ldur x0, [x0, #24]                  ; load property at resolved inherited offset
```

If the property does not exist but the class exposes `__get($name)`, codegen materializes the property name as a string literal, pushes it as an argument, and dispatches the instance method through the normal object-call path. The returned value then flows back through the ordinary result registers based on the inferred return type.

For property assignment (`$obj->prop = value`), the value is evaluated first, then stored at the resolved inherited offset. If the property is missing but the class exposes `__set($name, $value)`, codegen boxes the value as `Mixed`, materializes the property name, and dispatches `__set` instead of emitting a direct store.

Property-array writes use the same fixed-offset property resolution first, then delegate to the ordinary array storage paths for the nested container. `$obj->items[] = $value` lowers through `PropertyArrayPush`, and `$obj->items[$key] = $value` lowers through `PropertyArrayAssign`; both require a concrete array/assoc-array property rather than a magic `__set` fallback.

### Method call (`$obj->method(args)`)

1. Evaluate the object expression to get the pointer in `x0`
2. Push the object pointer onto the stack
3. Evaluate and push all arguments
4. Pop arguments into ABI registers, with the object pointer as the first argument (`x0`)
5. Load the object's `class_id`, fetch the class vtable pointer from `_class_vtable_ptrs`, load the method slot, and `blr` to the resolved implementation
6. Result is in the standard registers based on return type

Inside the method body, `$this` is the first parameter and lives in the function's first stack slot.

Private instance methods are the exception: they do not get vtable slots, so calls resolved to a private method of the current lexical class use a direct `_method_Class_method` branch instead of virtual dispatch.

### Static method call (`ClassName::method(args)`)

Static methods are called like regular functions, but with the label `_static_ClassName_methodName`. No object pointer is passed:

```asm
bl _static_Point_origin              ; call static method
; result in x0 (object pointer)
```

`self::method()` is handled as a direct call against the current lexical class. If it resolves to an instance method, codegen loads the implicit `$this` receiver and branches directly to the resolved `_method_Class_method` label. `parent::method()` works the same way against the immediate parent class. For static targets, codegen now also threads a hidden "called class id" argument through static method bodies: named `ClassName::method()` calls pin that id to the named class, while `self::` and `parent::` forward the current called class. `static::method()` then uses that forwarded class id to load the target from a per-class static-method table at runtime.

## The ABI module

**Files:** `src/codegen/abi/mod.rs`, `src/codegen/abi/`

Centralizes register conventions so they're consistent everywhere:

### Large offset addressing

ARM64's `stur`/`ldur` instructions only support 9-bit signed immediates (offsets up to 255). Functions with many local variables can exceed this limit. The ABI module handles this transparently via `store_at_offset()` and `load_at_offset()`:

- **Offsets <= 255**: single `stur`/`ldur` instruction (fast path)
- **Offsets 256-4095**: two-instruction sequence — `sub x9, x29, #offset` to compute the address in a scratch register, then `str`/`ldr` through that register

This means all codegen that accesses stack variables goes through the ABI helpers rather than emitting `stur`/`ldur` directly, so large stack frames work automatically. The same boundary now also owns indirect `[*ptr]` loads/stores used by by-reference params and mutation-heavy expression paths, so x86_64-specific memory syntax does not leak back into `expr.rs`.

`emit_frame_slot_address()` complements those helpers when codegen needs the address of a local slot itself rather than the value stored there. By-reference calls, `ptr($var)`, and exception-frame bookkeeping now all reuse that helper instead of open-coding frame-slot address math.

### Frame and return-value helpers

The `abi/` module now centralizes the frame-management primitives used by both `_main` and ordinary functions:

- `emit_frame_prologue()` / `emit_frame_restore()` — shared stack-frame setup and teardown
- `emit_cleanup_callback_prologue()` / `emit_cleanup_callback_epilogue()` — tiny helper frames used by exception cleanup callbacks
- `emit_preserve_return_value()` / `emit_restore_return_value()` — spill/reload of scalar, float, and string returns across epilogue side effects or `finally` dispatch

That moves prologue/epilogue mechanics out of the higher-level walkers and makes the ABI layer responsible for more than just local-slot addressing.

### Incoming argument lowering

Incoming parameter decoding now goes through `IncomingArgCursor` plus `emit_store_incoming_param()`.

The cursor tracks:

- current integer argument register index
- current floating-point argument register index
- when argument passing has overflowed to the caller stack
- the caller-stack byte offset for subsequent spilled parameters

Those helpers now understand both the AArch64 calling convention and the Linux `x86_64` SysV AMD64 target. Function codegen delegates incoming-parameter lowering to the ABI layer instead of open-coding register names or caller-stack offsets inline.

### Outgoing call argument lowering

Outgoing calls now use ABI-owned helpers as well:

- `build_outgoing_arg_assignments_for_target()` decides whether each argument lands in an integer register, a floating-point register, or overflows onto the caller-visible stack area for the selected target
- `materialize_outgoing_args()` rewrites the temporary pushed-argument stack into the final ABI layout expected at the call site

That logic is shared by ordinary function calls, indirect/callable dispatch, object/method calls, constructor/static dispatch, and helpers such as `call_user_func_array()`. The assignment/materialization rules now cover both AArch64 and Linux `x86_64` SysV layout, so the call ABI policy lives in one place instead of being duplicated across several dispatch paths.

The same module now also owns a thin layer of call-site and temporary-stack primitives used by higher-level walkers:

- `emit_call_label()` / `emit_call_reg()` emit direct and indirect calls for the current target
- `emit_push_reg()`, `emit_pop_reg()`, `emit_push_float_reg()`, `emit_pop_float_reg()`, `emit_push_reg_pair()`, `emit_pop_reg_pair()`, and `emit_push_result_value()` manage the temporary argument stack without hardcoding ARM64 push/pop forms in each call path
- `emit_reserve_temporary_stack()`, `emit_temporary_stack_address()`, and `emit_load_temporary_stack_slot()` now also back the FFI extern-call path, where borrowed C-string temporaries are tracked and released after the foreign call returns
- `emit_release_temporary_stack()` and `emit_store_zero_to_local_slot()` centralize target-specific stack cleanup and zero-initialization details
- `emit_store_process_args_to_globals()`, `emit_enable_heap_debug_flag()`, `emit_copy_frame_pointer()`, and `emit_exit()` cover the `_main` bootstrap/teardown path without hardcoding process-entry registers or exit sequences in the higher-level driver

That keeps target-specific ABI work focused inside `abi/` instead of scattering `call`, `blr`, `add sp`, `rsp`, or zero-register assumptions across function, closure, callable, and method dispatch code.

The same `abi/` layer now also owns symbol-slot plumbing for compiler-managed globals such as `_gvar_*`, `_static_*`, `_exc_*`, `_global_*`, and the high-frequency runtime symbols used by string builders, heap bookkeeping, and GC state such as `_concat_off`, `_heap_*`, and `_gc_*`: computing symbol addresses, moving result registers into symbol storage, loading symbol storage back into result registers, and copying local frame slots into symbol-backed storage during epilogues. Extern globals now use the same boundary too, so GOT/GOTPCREL address materialization lives in `abi/` instead of being open-coded separately in expression and statement lowering.

### `emit_store(emitter, type, offset)`

Stores the current result to a stack variable. Uses `store_at_offset()` internally to handle large offsets:

| Type | What it stores |
|---|---|
| `Int` / `Bool` / `Resource` | `stur x0, [x29, #-offset]` (or 2-insn sequence for large offsets) |
| `Float` | `stur d0, [x29, #-offset]` |
| `Str` | `bl __rt_str_persist`, then `stur x1, [x29, #-offset]` + `stur x2, [x29, #-(offset-8)]` |
| `Array` / `AssocArray` / `Iterable` | `stur x0, [x29, #-offset]` |
| `Mixed` | `stur x0, [x29, #-offset]` |
| `Object` | `stur x0, [x29, #-offset]` |
| `Callable` / `Pointer` | `stur x0, [x29, #-offset]` |
| `Buffer` / `Packed` / `Union` | `stur x0, [x29, #-offset]` |

### `emit_load(emitter, type, offset)`

Loads a stack variable into result registers (inverse of store). Uses `load_at_offset()` internally.

### `emit_write_stdout(emitter, type)`

Emits code to print a value to stdout:

| Type | How it prints |
|---|---|
| `Str` | move the string pointer/length into `__rt_stdout_write`'s convention, then `bl __rt_stdout_write` |
| `Int` | `bl __rt_itoa` → then write |
| `Float` | `bl __rt_ftoa` → then write |
| `Bool` | `true` prints "1", `false` prints nothing |
| `Pointer` | `bl __rt_ptoa` → then write |
| `Mixed` | `bl __rt_mixed_write_stdout` → inspect boxed runtime tag, then write |
| `Void`/`Array`/`AssocArray`/`Callable`/`Object` | Prints nothing |

The terminal write itself goes through one shared runtime indirection, `__rt_stdout_write(ptr, len)` (byte pointer in `x0`/`rdi`, length in `x1`/`rsi`). It performs the platform `write(1, ptr, len)` syscall directly. In `--web` builds it first checks the `_elephc_web_capture` flag and, when capture is enabled, hands the bytes to `elephc_web_write` instead so per-request response bodies can be captured; non-web binaries never reference the web symbols. (The `Mixed` / `Resource` / `Iterable` writers still issue their own syscalls and bypass this indirection.)

For Linux `x86_64`, the same write path now follows the SysV ABI and a broad native runtime slice rather than AArch64-specific helper sequences. String results use the Linux syscall register layout, integer and float echo go through x86_64 `__rt_itoa` / `__rt_ftoa`, `_main` initializes `$argc` / `$argv` only when needed, and the bootstrap runtime now covers a wide set of array, string, math, filesystem, FFI, enum, exception, GC, and mixed-value helpers without leaking AArch64-only assumptions back into the higher-level walkers.

That same bootstrap system slice now also includes x86_64-native `time()` / `microtime(true)` through libc `gettimeofday()`, target-aware `php_uname()` through libc `uname()`, plus package-version lowering for `phpversion()` and constant-string lowering for `sys_get_temp_dir()` via the shared symbol-address ABI helpers instead of ARM64-only `adrp` / `add_lo12` sequences.

The x86_64 math surface is broader now too: the libc-backed float builtin family (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, `exp`, `log`, `log2`, `log10`, `atan2`, `hypot`, `pow`) and the pure float helpers (`sqrt`, `pi`, `deg2rad`, `rad2deg`, `min`, `max`) all use SysV floating-point registers plus the shared temporary-stack ABI helpers instead of raw AArch64 `d0` / `scvtf` / `str d0` lowering. The same applies to the `**` operator in expression codegen, which now routes through the x86_64 `pow()` libc call path with the right floating argument order. The scalar random helpers (`rand()`, `mt_rand()`, `random_int()`) also live on that target-aware ABI path now, so their `[min, max]` range materialization no longer emits raw AArch64 stack spills on Linux x86_64. Comparator-driven indexed-array sorting is on that same path too: `usort()`, `uasort()`, and `uksort()` now resolve callback addresses through the shared symbol/stack ABI helpers and dispatch through an x86_64 `__rt_usort` bubble-sort runtime instead of hard-coded ARM64 `adrp` / `blr` sequences.

## Function codegen

**Files:** `src/codegen/functions/mod.rs`, `src/codegen/functions/`

### `emit_function()`

Compiles a user-defined function:

1. **Collect local variables** — scan the function body to find all variables and their types
2. **Calculate stack frame size** — 16-byte aligned, includes space for all locals
3. **Emit prologue** — call the shared ABI frame helper
4. **Store parameters** — lower incoming arguments through the ABI helpers into stack slots, marking by-value heap params as `Owned` and by-reference params as borrowed aliases of the caller's storage
5. **Emit body** — all statements
6. **Emit epilogue** — preserve return registers, save static locals back to BSS through the shared ABI storage helpers, clean up only `Owned` + `epilogue_cleanup_safe` heap locals, then call the shared ABI frame-restore helper and `ret`

### Pass by reference

```php
function increment(&$val) {
    $val++;
}
```

When a parameter is declared with `&`, the codegen passes the **stack address** of the argument instead of its value:

1. At the call site: the address of the argument's stack slot is computed (`sub x_n, x29, #offset`) and passed in the argument register.
2. In the function prologue: the address is stored in the parameter's stack slot (it holds a pointer, not a value).
3. On reads: the codegen dereferences the pointer (`ldr x0, [x0]`) to get the actual value.
4. On writes: the codegen stores through the pointer (`str x0, [addr]`), modifying the caller's variable directly.

The context tracks which parameters are pass-by-reference via `ctx.ref_params`.

### Variadic parameters and spread operator

```php
function sum(...$nums) { /* $nums is an array */ }
sum(1, 2, 3);
sum(...$arr);  // spread
```

**Variadic functions**: The last parameter can be prefixed with `...` to collect all remaining arguments into an array. At the call site, the codegen:

1. Passes regular (non-variadic) arguments normally via registers
2. Uses the shared helpers in `src/codegen/expr/calls/args.rs` to prepare normalized/defaulted argument lists, lower pass-by-reference slots, handle spread-into-named parameters, and build the trailing variadic array when needed
3. Passes the array pointer as the last argument register

**Spread operator** (`...$arr`): When calling a function with `...$arr`, the array is unpacked into positional parameters. For `function f($a, ...$rest)`, `f(...[1, 2, 3])` passes `1` to `$a` and collects `[2, 3]` into `$rest`. Associative-array spreads map string keys to named arguments, keep numeric keys positional, and collapse duplicate static string keys to the last value before planning. Variable `AssocArray` spreads before named arguments can satisfy later parameters by string key at runtime, so codegen skips fixed prefix length checks for that dynamic provider and emits per-parameter lookup/default handling instead. In array literals, the spread operator uses `__rt_array_merge_into` to append all elements from the spread array into the target array.

### Default parameter values

Functions and closures support default parameter values:

```php
function greet($name, $greeting = "Hello") { ... }
```

When a call site omits an argument that has a default value, the codegen fills in the default. At the call site, the compiler checks how many arguments were actually passed and, for each missing parameter with a default, evaluates the default expression and places it in the appropriate argument register. This is handled at compile time — no runtime checks are needed.

### `collect_local_vars()`

Pre-scans the function body AST to find every variable that will be used. This is necessary because stack space must be allocated in the prologue, before any code runs.

It walks the statement tree before code emission and handles the major local-binding forms recursively (`Assign`, control-flow blocks, `For`/`Foreach`, `ListUnpack`, `Global`, `StaticVar`, and related cases). The exact match is implementation-driven in the `functions/` module, so this list is illustrative rather than exhaustive.

## Main program codegen

**File:** `src/codegen/mod.rs`

The `generate()` function orchestrates everything:

1. **Emit user functions** — scan AST for `FunctionDecl`, emit each one
2. **Emit class methods** — constructor, instance methods, and static methods use their own labels
3. **Emit `_main`**:
   - Prologue (stack frame for global variables)
   - Save `argc` and `argv` from OS (they arrive in `x0` and `x1`)
   - Build `$argv` array via `__rt_build_argv` runtime call
   - Register the main activation record so exceptions can unwind through top-level code too
   - Emit all non-function statements
   - Epilogue: clean up owned locals, unregister the activation record, then `exit(0)`
4. **Emit deferred closures** — closure bodies recorded during earlier expression codegen
5. **Emit runtime routines** — all `__rt_*` helper functions
6. **Emit data section** — string and float literals
7. **Emit runtime data / BSS** — global buffers, globals, statics, and lookup tables

Linux x86_64 uses the same shared runtime emission surface as the AArch64 targets. Array transforms, sorting helpers, copy-on-write paths, GC accounting, heap debug helpers, string search/formatting helpers, inline array/string accessors, and list unpacking all route through target-aware emitters and the ABI module rather than a separate reduced runtime slice.

When an operation needs architecture-specific assembly, the leaf runtime module selects the native sequence internally. For example, x86_64 helpers use SysV registers, RIP-relative addressing, and x86_64 heap markers where needed, while AArch64 helpers use their own register and relocation conventions. Higher-level lowering should continue to call the shared runtime labels and ABI helpers instead of branching on raw ARM64 or x86_64 details.
